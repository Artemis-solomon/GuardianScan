### `requirements.txt`

```plaintext
Flask==2.1.0
```

This example specifies that your project requires Flask version 2.1.0. When you run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, it will install Flask and any dependencies specified in your `requirements.txt` file.

If your project uses additional libraries or dependencies, you can add them to the `requirements.txt` file. For example, if your vulnerability scanner relies on a specific version of `requests`, you can include it like this:

```plaintext
Flask==2.1.0
requests==2.26.0
```

Make sure to check and update the version numbers based on your project's compatibility. You can find the latest versions of packages on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

To generate the `requirements.txt` file based on the currently installed packages in your virtual environment, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This command will create a `requirements.txt` file with the names and versions of all installed packages in your virtual environment. Make sure to review and modify it as needed.
